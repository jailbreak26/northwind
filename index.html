Desiderata
<br><br>

Go placidly amid the noise and haste,<br>
and remember what peace there may be in silence.<br>
As far as possible without surrender<br>
be on good terms with all persons.<br>
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br>
and listen to others,<br>
even the dull and the ignorant;<br>
they too have their story. <br>
<p>
Avoid loud and aggressive persons,<br>
they are vexations to the spirit.<br>
If you compare yourself with others,<br>
you may become vain and bitter;<br>
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br>
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. <br>
<p>
Keep interested in your own career, however humble;<br>
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br>
Exercise caution in your business affairs;<br>
for the world is full of trickery.<br>
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;<br>
many persons strive for high ideals;<br>
and everywhere life is full of heroism. <br>
<p>
Be yourself.<br>
Especially, do not feign affection.<br>
Neither be cynical about love;<br>
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment<br>
it is as perennial as the grass. <br>
<p>
Take kindly the counsel of the years,<br>
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br>
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.<br>
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br>
Beyond a wholesome discipline,<br>
be gentle with yourself. <br>
<p>
You are a child of the universe,<br>
no less than the trees and the stars;<br>
you have a right to be here.<br>
And whether or not it is clear to you,<br>
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>
<p>
Therefore be at peace with God,<br>
whatever you conceive Him to be,<br>
and whatever your labors and aspirations,<br>
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. <br>
<p>
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,<br>
it is still a beautiful world.<br>
Be cheerful.<br>
Strive to be happy. <br>
